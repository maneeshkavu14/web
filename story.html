    <h1> STORY ABOUT MY FRIEND SUMANTH </h1>

    <h2> About SUMANTH!</h2>

    <p> In a small, vibrant town nestled by the hills, lived a young boy named <strong> Sumanth </strong>. Known for his boundless curiosity, Sumanth’s  big, bright eyes would light up at the sight of anything new. He loved exploring every corner of his town, asking questions, and learning about the world around him.

        One sunny morning, Sumanth woke up feeling especially adventurous. He had recently heard tales of a hidden forest beyond the hills, filled with ancient secrets and forgotten treasures. Determined to discover its mysteries, Sumanth decided that today was the perfect day to set off on a grand adventure.</p>

    <h3> Journey Begins</h3>
    <p>With a trusty backpack slung over his shoulders, a water bottle, and a self-drawn map, Sumanth began his journey. The path was not easy; it was filled with twists, turns, and overgrown trails. But nothing could deter the brave young explorer. He pushed forward with a cheerful heart, humming a little tune as he walked.

        After hours of hiking, he reached the edge of a dense forest. The air was filled with the sounds of chirping birds and rustling leaves. Sumanth could feel the thrill of adventure coursing through his veins.</p>
    
    <p>After hours of trekking, Sumanth reached the edge of a <strong> dense forest</strong>. The air was cooler here, filled with the scent of pine and earth. Just as he was about to venture deeper, he came across a sparkling stream. Sumanth, always ready to explore, crouched down to examine it closely. To his surprise, the stream spoke!

        “Who dares to enter my forest?” the stream asked, its voice as smooth as the water flowing over pebbles.
        
        “It's me, Sumanth, the curious explorer!” he replied confidently, his eyes twinkling with wonder.
        
        The stream seemed to smile, sensing the boy's pure heart and fearless spirit. “To go further, you must solve a riddle,” it said.
        
        Sumanth loved challenges, especially ones that made him think. He leaned forward, eager to hear the riddle:
        
        "I am always hungry, I must always be fed, The finger I touch, Will soon turn red. What am I?"
        
        Without missing a beat, Sumanth's face lit up with recognition. “It's fire!” he exclaimed with a triumphant grin.
        
        The stream, impressed by his quick wit, parted to reveal a hidden bridge that led deeper into the forest.</p>
